Raindrop Game
The goal of the game is to catch as many raindrops as possible with the catcher at the bottom.
The more you catch, the higher the score.
Left and right arrow keys control acceleration in either direction.
Right now, the catcher can't catch raindrops, I will update that.
I plan to make the raindrops appear at a faster rate once the game keeps going, maybe even give them some horizontal acceleration.
I also plan to add lives that decrease whenever you miss a raindrop.
If I have the time and ability, I might put a high score table in.
